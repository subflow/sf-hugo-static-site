My name is Jonas Olsson and i started Subflow in 2016. I have been working at large companies where backoffice tasks took alot of time. Creating reports and working with statistics. Even just copying information between different systems. I started to find efficient ways to automate these things. And i want to help smaller companies with these issues so that they can focus on what they truly want to do. So by automating backoffice tasks they can focus on their business. Automating the administration can actually give them the upper hand against large corporations.
